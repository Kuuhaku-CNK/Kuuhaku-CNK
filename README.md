## Hi there 👋
✨ I'm Châu Nguyên Khang aka CNK or Kuuhaku. 

🔭 I'm currently a student at University of Information Technology - VNUHCM. My major is Integrated Circuit Design.

🌱 I'm currently learning HDL at my school so I try to build some projects then upload to Github.

⚡ I'm also interested in coding some of my own project in Latex (usually just documents for studying subjects at school)
