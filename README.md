## Hi there ğŸ‘‹
âœ¨ I'm ChÃ¢u NguyÃªn Khang aka CNK or Kuuhaku. 
ğŸ”­ I'm currently a student at University of Information Technology - VNUHCM. My major is Integrated Circuit Design.
ğŸŒ± I'm currently learning Data Structures and Algorithm at my school so I try to solve problems on my school website and other website like Codeforces.
âš¡ I'm also interested in coding some of my own project in Latex (usually just documents for studying subject at school)
